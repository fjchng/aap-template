## 🔄 Complete Workflow

The framework follows a systematic breakdown approach:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] --> B[Architecture]
    B --> C[Standards]
    C --> D[Epics]
    D --> E[Stories]
    E --> F[Tasks]
    F --> G[AI Implementation]
    G --> H[Learning Capture]
    H --> F
```

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 days)

- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Define what to build and why
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Design how to build it
- **STANDARDS.md** - Establish quality guidelines

### Phase 2: Planning (1-2 days)

- **EPICS/** - Break requirements into major themes (2-3 weeks each)
- **STORIES/** - Define user value increments (2-5 days each)
- **TASKS/** - Create AI-implementable work units (2-4 hours each)

### Phase 3: Execution (Ongoing sprints)

- **Sprint Planning** - Select tasks for implementation
- **AI Implementation** - Execute tasks with AI agents
- **Learning Capture** - Document insights for improvement

## 📊 Success Metrics

The framework is designed to achieve:
