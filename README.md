# AI-Assisted Programming (AAP) Template

## What This Framework Is

This is a comprehensive documentation system designed to maximize success rates with AI-assisted programming. It transforms complex software projects into clear, actionable specifications that AI agents can follow systematically.

**Core Philosophy**: Front-load Overview and design to create manageable, well-defined tasks for AI agents.

## Purpose and Benefits

### Problems This Solves

- **Ambiguous Requirements** → Clear, testable specifications
- **Complex Tasks** → Bite-sized, implementable work items
- **Inconsistent Code** → Standardized patterns and practices
- **Knowledge Loss** → Cumulative learning and pattern recognition
- **Agent Failures** → Optimized prompts and task definitions

### Key Benefits

- **80%+ AI Task Success Rate** through proper breakdown and specification
- **Consistent Code Quality** via enforced standards and patterns
- **Faster Development** through reusable patterns and optimized workflows
- **Knowledge Accumulation** that improves over time
- **Reduced Technical Debt** through upfront architectural Overview

## Key Features

### 1. Task Granularity

All tasks are broken down into 2-4 hour units, perfectly sized for AI agent implementation.

### 2. Learning Loop System

- Captures insights from each sprint
- Updates standards and templates based on learnings
- Compounds knowledge over time for better AI performance

### 3. Clear Success Criteria

Every task includes:

- Specific input/output requirements
- Detailed business logic steps
- Error handling specifications
- Testing requirements

### 4. Visual Documentation

Extensive use of Mermaid diagrams for system architecture, workflows, and sequence diagrams.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the template**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd aap-template
   ```

2. **Read the Getting Started Guide**

   ```bash
   open ProjectPlanTemplate/GettingStarted.md
   ```

3. **Follow the setup workflow**
   - Define your requirements
   - Design your system architecture
   - Establish coding standards
   - Plan your first sprint

## Workflow Overview

```mermaid

    A[Requirements] --> B[Architecture]
    B --> C[Standards]
    C --> D[Sprint Planning]
    D --> E[Task Execution]
    E --> F[Testing]
    F --> G[Learning Capture]
    G --> D
```

## Project Management Hierarchy

- **Epic**: Large feature or initiative (multiple sprints)
- **Story**: User-facing functionality (1-2 per sprint)
- **Task**: AI-implementable work unit (2-4 hours)

## Sprint Cycle

1. **Review**: Analyze previous sprint learnings
2. **Plan**: Select 1-2 stories for the sprint
3. **Break Down**: Convert stories into AI-friendly tasks
4. **Execute**: Implement tasks with AI agents
5. **Test**: Validate implementation
6. **Learn**: Capture insights for future improvements

## Testing Strategy

The template follows the testing pyramid:

- **70%** Unit Tests
- **20%** Integration Tests
- **10%** End-to-End Tests

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a single story in your first sprint
2. **Document Everything**: Use the provided templates consistently
3. **Iterate Frequently**: Regular learning cycles improve AI performance
4. **Visual First**: Use diagrams to communicate complex concepts
5. **Test Continuously**: Validate at every level of development
