- Architecture: @ARCHITECTURE.md
- Standards: @STANDARDS.md

Process:
1. Group related functional requirements from REQUIREMENTS.md into epic themes
2. Align epics with architecture layers from ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Consider implementation complexity based on STANDARDS.md
4. Create dependency mapping between epics
5. Assign priorities using P0-P3 framework:
   - P0: Foundation/Security (must have first)
   - P1: Core Features (essential user value)
   - P2: Enhanced Features (important but not critical)
   - P3: Advanced Features (nice to have)

Epic Sizing Guidelines:
- Each epic should represent 2-3 weeks of work
- Include 3-6 stories maximum per epic

2. Align stories with architecture layers (Frontend, API, Business Logic, Data)
3. Apply story point estimation using fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
4. Create dependency mapping between stories
5. Ensure stories fit within sprint boundaries (2-5 days each)

Story Sizing Guidelines:
- 1 point: Simple component or basic CRUD (1-2 days)
- 2 points: Standard form with validation (2-3 days)
- 3 points: Complex feature with integrations (3-4 days)
- 5 points: Advanced multi-component feature (4-5 days)
- 8 points: **BREAK DOWN** - Too large for single story

Each story must:
- Deliver independent user value
- Be testable and demonstrable
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Reference parent epic and requirements

Output complete STORIES_OVERVIEW.md with estimation summary and dependency mapping.
```

**Output**: `STORIES/STORIES_OVERVIEW.md`

#### Step 5.2: Generate Individual Story Files

**Input**: `STORIES/STORIES_OVERVIEW.md` + `@STORY-001.md` template

5. Identify technical requirements (Frontend/Backend/Database components)
6. Reference parent epic and related requirements with IDs
7. Include comprehensive definition of done checklist

**Actions**:

1. Create `TASKS/` folder in project root
2. Generate `TASKS/TASKS_OVERVIEW.md`

**AI Prompt**:

```
Create TASKS/TASKS_OVERVIEW.md by breaking down stories into AI-implementable tasks using @4.4.1_TasksOverview.md as a template.

Reference Documents:
- Story Overview: @STORIES/STORIES_OVERVIEW.md
- Individual Stories: @STORIES/STORY-XXX.md files

## Quality Gates and Success Criteria

### Foundation Phase Gates

- [ ] REQUIREMENTS.md covers all user needs with measurable criteria
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md supports all requirements with justified technology choices
- [ ] STANDARDS.md is customized for chosen technology stack

### Planning Phase Gates

- [ ] All requirements mapped to epics in EPICS_OVERVIEW.md
- [ ] All epics broken into 3-6 stories with clear user value
- [ ] All stories broken into 2-6 tasks sized 2-4 hours each
- [ ] Dependencies are manageable and well-documented

### Execution Phase Gates

- [ ] 85%+ AI task success rate maintained
- [ ] All tasks meet acceptance criteria before marking complete
- [ ] Sprint progress tracked accurately in TASKS_OVERVIEW.md
- [ ] Learnings captured and applied to improve future sprints

## Common Troubleshooting

### Low AI Success Rate

- **Check**: Task complexity (should be 2-4 hours max)
- **Check**: Task context (include all necessary reference documents)
- **Apply**: Success patterns from LEARNINGS.md
- **Action**: Break down complex tasks into smaller units

### Dependency Blocking

- **Check**: TASKS_OVERVIEW.md dependency mapping
- **Action**: Implement prerequisite tasks first
- **Alternative**: Reorder sprint tasks to resolve dependencies

### Requirements Gaps

- **Check**: Traceability from REQUIREMENTS.md through epics/stories/tasks
- **Action**: Update requirements and propagate changes through all levels
- **Document**: Changes in LEARNINGS.md for future reference

## Best Practices for Maximum Success

1. **Always Reference Templates**: Use `@filename.md` to provide complete context
2. **Single Responsibility**: One task = one component/endpoint/database change
3. **Clear Context**: Include all relevant reference documents in prompts
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Apply learnings from LEARNINGS.md to each new sprint
5. **Quality First**: Maintain standards compliance and testing requirements
6. **Track Progress**: Keep TASKS_OVERVIEW.md updated with accurate status

This workflow ensures systematic breakdown of any project into AI-implementable tasks while maintaining quality, traceability, and continuous improvement.
