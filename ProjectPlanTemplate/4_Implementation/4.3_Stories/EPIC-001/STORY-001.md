## User Story

**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account with email and password  
**So that** I can access the application and use its features

---

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

New users need a way to create accounts to access the application. Without registration, users cannot authenticate or use protected features.

### Business Value

- Enables user acquisition and onboarding
- Creates foundation for user authentication system
- Supports business growth through new user acquisition
- Required for all subsequent user-dependent features

### Success Impact

- Conversion rate from visitor to registered user
- Reduced support tickets for account creation issues
- Foundation for user engagement metrics

---

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Registration Form Display

**Given** I am a new user visiting the registration page  
**When** I navigate to /register  
**Then** I should see a registration form with email, password, first name, and last name fields  
**And** all fields should be properly labeled and accessible  
**And** form should include submit and cancel buttons

### AC2: Field Validation

**Given** I am filling out the registration form  
**When** I enter invalid data  
**Then** I should see inline validation messages  
**And** the form should not submit until all validations pass

**Validation Rules:**

- Email: Required, valid email format, max 255 characters
- Password: Required, min 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- First Name: Required, max 50 characters, alphabetic only
- Last Name: Required, max 50 characters, alphabetic only

### AC3: Successful Registration

**Given** I have entered valid registration data  
**When** I submit the form  
**Then** I should see a success message  
**And** I should be redirected to the login page  
**And** I should receive a welcome email (if email service is available)

### AC4: Error Handling

**Given** I submit the registration form  
**When** there is a server error or email already exists  
**Then** I should see an appropriate error message  
**And** the form should remain populated with my data  
**And** I should be able to retry submission

### AC5: Accessibility & UX

**Given** I am using assistive technology  
**When** I interact with the registration form  
**Then** all form elements should be accessible via keyboard navigation  
**And** screen readers should properly announce field labels and validation messages  
**And** error states should have proper ARIA attributes

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation

- **Component**: `RegistrationForm.tsx`
- **Location**: `src/components/auth/`
- **State Management**: Local component state with React hooks
- **Validation**: Real-time client-side validation
- **Styling**: Follow design system components and accessibility guidelines

### API Integration

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Request Format**: JSON with user registration data
- **Response Handling**: Success/error states with user feedback
- **Error Scenarios**: Validation errors, duplicate email, server errors

### Data Requirements

```typescript
interface RegistrationData {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

interface RegistrationResponse {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  user?: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
  errors?: {
    field: string;
    message: string;
  }[];
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Password strength validation on client and server
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- CSRF protection for form submission
- Rate limiting to prevent spam registrations

## Design & UX Specifications

### Visual Design

- Follow established design system patterns
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Include loading states and micro-interactions

### User Experience Flow

1. User navigates to registration page
2. User fills out form with real-time validation feedback
3. User submits form with loading indicator
4. User sees success message and redirects to login
5. User receives welcome email (future enhancement)

### Error States

- Field-level validation errors (inline)
- Form-level submission errors (banner)
- Network error handling with retry options
- Graceful degradation for JavaScript disabled

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Form component rendering
- Validation logic functions
- Error state handling
- User interaction flows

### Integration Tests

- API integration with mock responses
- Form submission end-to-end flow
- Error handling with various API responses

### Accessibility Tests

- Keyboard navigation functionality
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA label correctness
- Color contrast compliance

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Form displays correctly on all screen sizes
- [ ] All validation rules work as expected
- [ ] Success flow completes without errors
- [ ] Error states display appropriate messages
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (form responds quickly)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Complex validation logic may be difficult to maintain
- **Mitigation**: Use validation library and create reusable validation functions

- **Risk**: API integration failures could block user registration
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### Business Risks

- **Risk**: Poor UX could reduce conversion rates
- **Mitigation**: Follow UX best practices and conduct usability testing

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in registration process
- **Mitigation**: Follow security guidelines and conduct security review

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- Social media registration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Email verification workflow
- Progressive profiling (collect additional info over time)
- Registration analytics and conversion tracking

### Technical Debt

- Consider password strength meter component
- Evaluate form library adoption for complex validation
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) support
