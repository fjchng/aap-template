## Sprint Planning

### Pre-Planning: Learning Review

**Apply insights from previous sprints before planning new work**

#### Learning Review Checklist

- [ ] Read through all previous sprint learnings
- [ ] Identify patterns applicable to upcoming stories
- [ ] Update task breakdown methodologies based on learnings
- [ ] Refine AI agent prompts based on successful patterns
- [ ] Adjust story point estimates based on actual vs estimated effort
- [ ] Update coding standards with new best practices
- [ ] Modify Definition of Done based on quality insights

### Sprint Goal Definition

```markdown
Sprint [Number] Goal: [1-2 sentence description of main deliverable]

Success Metrics:

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] User feedback score > [target]

Stories Included:

- Story [ID]: [Title] - [Story Points]
- Story [ID]: [Title] - [Story Points]

Learning Integration:

- Apply [specific learning] from Sprint [N-1]
- Focus on [quality area] identified in retrospective
```

### Task Prioritization

1. **Critical Path**: Tasks that unblock other work
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Complex tasks early in sprint
3. **User Value**: Customer-facing features
4. **Technical Foundation**: Infrastructure for future stories

## Sprint Demo

### Demo Agenda (30-45 minutes)

1. **Sprint Goal Review** (5 min): Recap objectives and completed work
2. **Feature Demonstrations** (20-30 min): Live demo of completed features
3. **Stakeholder Feedback** (10 min): User experience observations
4. **Metrics Review** (5 min): Performance and quality metrics

### Feedback Collection

- **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
- **Usability**: Is it easy to use and understand?
- **Performance**: Does it respond quickly enough?
- **Value**: Does it solve the intended problem?
