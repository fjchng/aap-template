## Story Point System

### Point Tiers

| Points | Complexity | Duration  | Task Count | Description                                           |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Simple     | 1-2 days  | 1-2 tasks  | Basic CRUD operations, simple UI components           |
| **2**  | Standard   | 2-3 days  | 2-3 tasks  | Standard feature with validation, moderate complexity |
| **3**  | Complex    | 3-4 days  | 3-4 tasks  | Complex feature with multiple integrations            |
| **5**  | Advanced   | 4-6 days  | 4-6 tasks  | Advanced feature requiring multiple components        |
| **8**  | Epic       | 1-2 weeks | 6+ tasks   | Epic-level work, needs breakdown into smaller stories |

### Estimation Factors

#### Technical Complexity

- **Algorithm Complexity**: Simple logic (1pt) → Complex algorithms (3-5pts)
- **Integration Points**: No integrations (1pt) → Multiple external APIs (3-5pts)
- **Data Complexity**: Simple CRUD (1pt) → Complex data transformations (3-5pts)

#### Uncertainty Level

- **Requirements Clarity**: Well-defined (1pt) → Ambiguous requirements (3-5pts)
- **Technical Knowledge**: Familiar technology (1pt) → New/unknown tech (3-5pts)
- **Dependencies**: No dependencies (1pt) → Multiple blocking dependencies (3-5pts)

#### Testing Scope

- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests only (1pt) → E2E + integration tests (3-5pts)
- **Edge Cases**: Few edge cases (1pt) → Many complex edge cases (3-5pts)

### Breakdown Rules

- If story > 5 points → Break into smaller stories
- If task > 4 hours estimated → Break into sub-tasks
- Each task should have single responsibility
- Tasks should be independently testable
- Maximum 6 tasks per story for manageability

### Estimation Examples

#### 1 Point Examples

- Create simple user registration form
- Add basic input validation

#### 2 Point Examples

- User login with JWT authentication
- Create project with validation and persistence
- Implement file upload with basic processing

#### 3 Point Examples

- Password reset flow with email integration
- Complex dashboard with multiple data sources
- Payment processing with external gateway

#### 5 Point Examples

- Complete user management system
- Advanced search with filtering and pagination
- Real-time notification system

#### 8 Point Examples (Break Down Required)

- Complete authentication system
- Full project management module
- Advanced reporting and analytics system
